# SignalQualityIndex
The Signal Quality Index (SQI) algorithm is a novel tool for quantitatively assessing the quality of fNIRS signals in a numeric scale from 1 (very low quality) to 5 (very high quality). The algorithm comprises two preprocessing steps followed by three consecutive rating stages: 
1) Identifying very low quality signals.
2) Identifying very high quality signals. 
3) Signal quality rating.
